# AddIn.Installed property (Excel)

**True** if the add-in is installed or to install the add-in; **False** if the add-in is uninstalled or to uninstall the add-in. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Installed**

_expression_ A variable that represents an **[AddIn](Excel.AddIn.md)** object.


## Remarks

Setting this property to **True** installs the add-in and calls its Auto_Add functions. Setting this property to **False** removes the add-in and calls its Auto_Remove functions.


## Example

This example uses a message box to display the installation status of the Solver add-in.

```vb
Dim SolverAddIn as AddIn
Set SolverAddIn = AddIns("Solver Add-In")

If SolverAddIn.Installed = True Then 
 MsgBox "The Solver add-in is installed" 
Else 
 MsgBox "The Solver add-in is not installed" 
End If
```
